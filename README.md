# Project Proposal

### Project title

The Home App

### What and why?

Managing a household of soccer games, after-school programs, drop-offs and pick-ups isn't easy. An app to track your schedule, along with those of each member in your household, is the perfect solution to staying up to date with eachother. Busy schedules call for stressful households, with caretakers often juggling their work schedules with those of their children. However, this app is intended to allow users to log and share their activity schedule with family members, receive reminders before important events, and always keep eachother updated and connected.

### For whom?

The software is designed for families with multiple members. The app is intended to be used by parents, guardians, babysitters, teens, and older children. 

### How?

Users can join their families virtual "Home" where they will have access to eachother's schedules. Users can log their own personal schedule, and set family reminders for special events.  

### Scope

The app is very straight-forward, it is ultimately a scheduling app with a page for the user's scedule, and a separate page for a family schedule. There also needs to be a notification implementation and possibly a text/communication feature which will require more research.
