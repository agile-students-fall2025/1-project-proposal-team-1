# Project Proposal

### Project title

The Home App

### What and why?

Managing a household of soccer games, after-school programs, drop-offs and pick-ups isn't easy. An app to track your schedule, along with those of each member in your household, is the perfect solution to staying up to date with everyone in your family. Busy schedules call for stressful households, with caretakers often juggling their work schedules and those of their children. However, this app is intended to allow users to log and share their activity schedule with family members, receive reminders before important events, and always keep eachother updated and connected.

### For whom?

The software is designed for families with multiple members. The app is intended to be used by parents, guardians, babysitters, teens, and older children with a phone. 

### How?

Users can join their families virtual "Home" where they will have access to eachother's schedules in a single page. Users can also log their own personal schedule in a separate page. After creating an event, they will be given the option to set app reminders.  

### Scope

The fundamentals of the app are very straight-forward- it is ultimately a scheduling app with a page for the user's schedule, and a separate page for a family schedule. There also needs to be a notification implementation and possibly a text/communication feature which will require more research and more team members.
